[Verse 1]
I got to take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older
Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like a world upon my shoulders
I through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

[Pre-Chorus]
In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

[Chorus]
I want to know what love is
I want you to show me
I want to feel what love is
I know you can show me

[Verse 2]
I'm going to take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I want to know what love is
I want you to show me
And I want to feel, I want to feel what love is
And I know, I know you can show me

[Verse 3]
Let's talk about love
I want to know what love is, the love that you feel inside
I want you to show me, and I'm feeling so much love
I want to feel what love is, no, you just cannot hide
I know you can show me, yeah

[Outro]
I want to know what love is, let's talk about love
I want you to show me, I want to feel it too
I want to feel what love is, I want to feel it too
And I know and I know, I know you can show me
Show me love is real, yeah
I want to know what love is
